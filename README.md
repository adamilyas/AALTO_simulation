## Course Objective (from course website)
The objective of the course is to teach students to use discrete event simulations as a method for performance evaluation of data networks and computer systems. The general information about the course in WebOodi is available [here](https://oodi.aalto.fi/a/opintjakstied.jsp?html=1&Kieli=6&Tunniste=ELEC-E7460).

We build on the basic knowledge that students have on probability and Markov processes from their bachelor studies. Discrete event simulation is a statistical method that can be used to study system sunder non-Markovian assumptions. On this course the student will learn the fundamentals of the discrete event simulation method, as well as the development of simulation programs using Mathematica. We develop simulation models of queueing systems that are motivated by recent research on, e.g., wireless systems as well as data centers. Simulation relies on random number generation and the picture below shows random samples generated in a unit square with probability density f(x,y)=x+y !

## Learning Outcomes
1. The student can analyze the performance of non-Markovian systems by using discrete event simulation, including the appropriate statistical analysis of the simulation data.
2. The student can design a new random number generator for a given distribution, when a standard generator is not available.
3. The student can simulate complex multi-server queuing models that are used to model computer and communication systems.
4. The student can develop simulation programs using Mathematica.
